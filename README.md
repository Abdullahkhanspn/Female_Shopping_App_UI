Female Shopping App UI using Jetpack Compose.

Today I dove deeper into Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, and the result? A professional shopping app for women with a sleek and modern UI! ðŸš€

Designing smooth and intuitive interfaces isnâ€™t just about codeâ€”itâ€™s about creating a seamless experience for users. This project has helped me level up my Jetpack Compose skills, from grid layouts to responsive design. ðŸŽ¨

ðŸ‘— Clean UI
ðŸ›’ Effortless Navigation
ðŸ’¡ Polished Shopping Experience
